## Weather forecast app for an Apple job application


### Requirements
* Ruby version
  * Ruby 3.2.0 is required

* Configuration
  * Be sure to enable rails cache `rails dev:cache`

* Database
  * Not needed

* How to run the test suite

* Running the app
  * Run `rails s` in the project directory


### Notes
- I left my API key for OpenWeatherData in the .env file as a way to make it easy for you to run, idealy though this should just be stored in a `.env.local` file.
